    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example?\n",
    "Ans1. A class is a user-defined data type that defines a blueprint for creating objects. It contains attributes, which are variables that hold data, and methods, which are functions that can be called to perform operations on the data. Classes allow us to encapsulate data and functionality into a single unit, making it easier to manage and reuse code.\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that has its own data and methods. When an object is created, it is initialized with the attributes and methods defined in its class.\n",
